Hello World ðŸ‘‹, I'm Paul.

I'm currently an intern at a company where I am honing my skills in Java and Spring Boot. As a student at WyÅ¼sza SzkoÅ‚a Technologii Informatycznych, I'm relatively new to the programming world but am very eager to learn and practice. My primary focus is on backend technologies, particularly Java, but I'm also keen to explore frontend development and good testing practices. My approach to software development is enthusiastic as I strive to develop my architectural skills and create domain-driven software that aligns well with business needs.

My personal projects showcase my passion for programming, as I aim to create user-friendly and efficient applications. I constantly experiment with various technologies and programming languages, seeking to expand my knowledge and explore new possibilities.

My coursework and internship tasks allow me to refine my programming skills and apply theoretical knowledge to practical problems. This practical experience is crucial as I aim to become a proficient programmer. I'm always ready for new learning opportunities and enjoy tackling recruitment challenges that push me to solve unique problems in creative ways, further developing my skills.
